Crypto Market Tracker is a web application built with React that allows users to track the latest information and statistics about cryptocurrencies. It provides real-time data on various cryptocurrencies, including their market prices, price changes, and market capitalization. Users can also navigate through different pages of the cryptocurrency list and view additional details about each cryptocurrency.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop this application:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components and provides a fast and efficient way to update and render components.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): A popular HTTP client library for making AJAX requests. It is used to fetch data from external APIs.
- [React Loader Spinner](https://github.com/mhnpd/react-loader-spinner): A React component that displays a loading spinner while waiting for data to load. It enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback during data fetching.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): A library for handling routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different pages and components based on the URL.
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): A library that provides a set of customizable icons for use in React applications. It offers a wide range of icons to enhance the visual appearance of the application.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is used for styling the components and creating a visually appealing user interface. The application utilizes a combination of custom styles and the Tailwind CSS utility framework.
- [Coingecko API](https://coingecko.com/api/documentation): An API that provides access to cryptocurrency market data. It is used to fetch real-time information about cryptocurrencies, including their prices, market caps, and price changes.
- [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/): An API that provides exchange rate data for different currencies. It is used to fetch the exchange rate between USD and UAH, enabling the conversion of cryptocurrency prices to the Ukrainian hryvnia.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): The application's source code is hosted on GitHub, a web-based hosting service for version control and collaboration.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
