Crypto Market Tracker is a web application built with Next.js, a popular React framework, that allows users to track the latest information and statistics about cryptocurrencies. It provides real-time data on various cryptocurrencies, including their market prices, price changes, and market capitalization. Users can also navigate through different pages of the cryptocurrency list and view additional details about each cryptocurrency.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
